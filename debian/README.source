The packaging is based on the upstream git repository.  However, the
upstream release tarballs are different.

* We use pristine-tar.
* We manually clean some generated files at build time (we re-create
  them anyway).

Before building a new release, be sure to download the tarball and
commit it with pristine-tar.
